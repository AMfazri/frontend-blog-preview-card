## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- React js

### What I learned

- I learned how to use React js for this Project

- I learned how to make the position of footer which is in the edge of bottom without changes the card position

- Fix blank github page, which is caused by base path in react not defined yet

### Continued development

in next challange, i want to keep use semantic html5 markup and React. i hope using these methods regularly that will make me feel comfort and be a good habitual.
